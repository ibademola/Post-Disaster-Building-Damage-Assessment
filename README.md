# Post-Disaster-Building-Damage-Assessment
A deep learning-based workflow for rapid building damage classification using high resolution aerial photographs (UAV or satellite imagery).

# Post-Disaster Building Damage Assessment

# Start Up

## Overview
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach for rapid post-disaster building damage classification using UAV and satellite imagery.

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` – Contains the Jupyter notebook with the main workflow.
- `src/` – Python scripts.
- `data/` – Smaple datasets and instructions to obtain new data.
- `results/` – Directory for generated outputs including plots, figures, and trained models.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Post-Disaster-Building-Damage-Assessment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/BDA2_Clean.ipynb
   ```

## Tools & Libraries
